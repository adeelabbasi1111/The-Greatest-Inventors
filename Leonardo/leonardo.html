          <h3>Flying Machine</h3>
          <p>
            <h5>Leonardo's dream to fly like a bird : </h5> <p>Da Vinci was obsessed with
            flight. Inspired by birds and bats, he sketched what‚Äôs called the
            Ornithopter‚Äîa human-powered flying machine with large, flapping
            wings. It looked like something straight out of a steampunk fantasy:
            a person lies face-down in the center, using pedals and pulleys to
            flap the wings.</p> <h5>Why it‚Äôs interesting: </h5> <p>Leonardo studied bird
            flight obsessively, filling notebooks with aerodynamic concepts‚Äîhe
            even figured out basic principles of lift and drag long before
            Newton or Bernoulli. While the machine wouldn‚Äôt have worked (human
            muscles just aren‚Äôt strong enough), the idea planted seeds for
            modern aviation.</p>

          <h3>Armored Tank</h3>

          <p>
            A rolling fortress with 360¬∞ firepower Picture a giant turtle made
            of metal, covered in cannons. That‚Äôs Leonardo‚Äôs tank. Shaped like a
            saucer or a spiked UFO, it had sloped armor to deflect enemy fire
            and was powered by men inside cranking gears. ‚öôÔ∏è Cool twist: He
            intentionally designed the gears wrong. Scholars think he sabotaged
            his own blueprint in case it fell into the wrong hands‚Äîhe was a
            pacifist at heart and didn‚Äôt want his inventions used for senseless
            violence.

          <h3>Self-Propelled Cart</h3>
          <p>
            The Renaissance-era robot car Often called the ancestor of the
            modern automobile, this spring-powered cart could move on its own
            without being pushed or pulled. It even had steering and
            programmable direction controls using cams‚Äîsort of like a wind-up
            Roomba from the 1400s. üé≠ Fun fact: Historians believe it was
            designed to move across stage sets for Renaissance theater‚Äîimagine
            surprising the audience with a rolling mechanical device when they'd
            never even seen wheels move by themselves before!

          <h3>Robotic Knight</h3>
          <p>
            Leonardo‚Äôs 15th-century automaton warrior This mechanical knight
            could sit, stand, move its arms, lift its visor, and even move its
            jaw. Designed with pulleys and gears hidden beneath a suit of armor,
            it was the first humanoid robot ever conceptualized. üé© The showman
            side: He likely built it for a Milanese court celebration to dazzle
            nobles. If so, this makes Leonardo not just a scientist and artist,
            but one of the world‚Äôs first roboticists and special effects
            designers.
