    <h1 style="text-align: center">Introduction</h1>
    <p>Tesla was born in 1856 in present-day Croatia. He was a gifted student, particularly in math and physics. Nikola
      Tesla was a brilliant Serbian-American inventor and engineer who is best known for his contributions to the design
      of the modern alternating current (AC) electrical system. He also made significant advancements in wireless
      communication and other electrical technologies.</p>

        <h3>Alternating Current (AC)</h3>
        <div>
          <h5>Nikola Tesla dreamed of using Alternating Current (AC) to provide efficient, low-cost
            electricity to everyone. :</h5>
          <p>
            Nikola Tesla created the AC system to send electricity
            over long distances. It was more efficient than DC.
            By 1895, AC powered cities like Buffalo from Niagara Falls.
            Tesla’s goal was to give cheap electricity to everyone.
          </p>
          <h5>Why it’s interesting:</h5>
          <p>
            It’s interesting because Tesla’s AC made it possible to
            power whole cities from far away, changing how the world
            uses electricity..

        <h3>Tesla Coil</h3>

        <div>
          <p>Tesla’s dream for the Tesla Coil was to create wireless electricity, so power could be sent through the
            air without wires, reaching homes and devices worldwide. <br>
            The Tesla Coil, invented in 1891,
            is a high-voltage transformer that produces powerful electric sparks. It was used in early radio, wireless
            power experiments, and to study electricity. Tesla dreamed it would one day transmit electricity wirelessly
            around the world.
          </p>
          <h5>Cool twist:</h5>
          <p>
            A cool twist about the Tesla Coil is that
            it’s not just a scientific device—it’s also a stunning light show! When powered, it creates spectacular
            lightning-like sparks and glowing plasma, almost like controlled mini lightning bolts dancing in the air.
            Tesla basically invented a way to make electricity look magical!

        <h3>Radio</h3>
        <div>
          <h5>Nikola Tesla dreamed of a world where people could send voice, music, and messages wirelessly.
          </h5>
          <p>
            Nikola Tesla dreamed of a future where people could communicate wirelessly across the world. In the 1890s,
            he demonstrated wireless
            signal transmission and received a patent for his radio invention in 1897.
          </p>
          <h5>Fun fact:</h5>
          <p>
            Nikola Tesla not only dreamed of wireless
            communication but also predicted technology far beyond his time. He once said people would carry small
            devices in their pockets to talk across the world —

        <h3>Remote Control</h3>
        <div>
          <h5>Nikola Tesla dreamed of controlling machines wirelessly.
            He imagined boats, vehicles, and even robots being operated from a distance without wires.
          </h5>
          <p>
            Tesla demonstrated a radio-controlled boat at Madison
            Square Garden, shocking the audience.
            He called it "teleautomaton" and saw a future where machines could follow human commands remotely.
            Tesla believed remote control could be used for warfare, industry, and everyday life. Though people didn’t
            fully understand it then, his ide
          </p>
          <h5>The showman side:</h5>
          <p>
          Nikola Tesla wasn’t just a scientist — he was also a performer. He loved demonstrating his inventions in
          dramatic and exciting ways
          . In public shows, he would light bulbs with his hands, shoot lightning from coils, and amaze the crowd with
          wireless electricity.

          He wore stylish clothes, spoke politely, and impressed rich investors with his confident, theatrical style.
