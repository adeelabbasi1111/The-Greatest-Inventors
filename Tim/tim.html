  <p>
    Sir Tim Berners-Lee (born 1955) is a British computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. 
    His groundbreaking idea revolutionized the way we access and share information, forever changing the digital world.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1989, while working at CERN, Tim proposed a system for sharing information using hypertext.
     That idea became the  World Wide Web—a way for people around the world to connect through websites and hyperlinks.
      He also created the first web browser and web server, laying the foundation for the internet we use today.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tim Berners-Lee’s vision of a free and open web helped spark a digital revolution. Even now, he continues to fight 
    for data privacy, internet freedom, and making the web accessible for everyone across the globe.

          <h3>World Wide Web (WWW)</h3>
          <div>
            <h5>The Tech Side:</h5>
            <p>Invented in 1989, launched in 1991, the World Wide Web was the blueprint for the modern
               internet — a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via browsers.
                It was built on top of the internet, which already existed as a basic data-sharing system.
            </p>
            <h5>The Showman Side:</h5>
            <p>
             At CERN in Geneva, Tim Berners-Lee didn’t just want data — he wanted human access.
             He gave the world a stage where everyone could publish, connect, and be seen.
              It wasn’t just invention — it was democratization of knowledge.

          <h3>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</h3>

          <div>
            <h5>The Building Blocks:</h5>
            <p>
              Released in 1991, HTML was the first language to structure content on the web.
               It gave form to chaos — headers, links, paragraphs, images — everything arranged
                like a digital skeleton for the Web’s body.
            </p>
            <h5>The Vision Behind the Code:</h5>
            <p>
             Berners-Lee wasn't just inventing code — he was designing a language for digital creators.
              HTML wasn’t flashy, but it was powerful — a quiet revolution that let the whole world express itself online.
               Every blog, meme, and article today owes its bones to HTML.

          <h3>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h3>
          <div>
            <h5>How It Works:</h5>
            <p>
              HTTP, created in 1991, was the Web’s messenger protocol — making requests between browsers and servers.
You click → your browser politely asks the server → the server responds with data → voilà, the website loads.
            </p>
            <h5> The Magic of Connection:</h5>
            <p>
             It’s not just wires and code. HTTP is the invisible handshake that makes the web feel alive.
              It turned distant machines into cooperative partners, speaking a common digital tongue.
               Without it, clicking a link would be like yelling into the void.

          <h3>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</h3>
          <div>
            <h5>What It Does:</h5>
            <p>
             Invented around 1992, a URL is the unique address of every page, image, or file on the Web.
              Like digital street names, URLs tell browsers exactly where to go.
            </p>
            <h5>Why It Changed Everything:</h5>
            <p>
             With URLs, knowledge had a permanent home. It gave the web a sense of place.
              Instead of "go find it", it became "here it is". You could summon any file on Earth — instantly.
               That’s not tech. That’s power.
