    <h1 style="text-align: center">Introduction</h1>
  <p > Thomas Alva Edison (1847–1931) was a prolific American 
      inventor and businessman who is widely regarded as one of the greatest
      inventors in history. He held over 1,000 patents and is best known for 
      inventing the phonograph, the incandescent light bulb, and the motion
      picture camera. Edison played a key role in bringing electric power to
      the masses and contributed significantly to modern life through his innovations. <br><br>
      Born in Milan, Ohio, and raised in Michigan, Edison had little formal education 
      but was an avid reader and experimenter from a young age. His first major invention, 
      the phonograph, brought him international fame. Later, he founded General Electric,
      one of the largest and most influential companies in the world today.
      Edison’s work ethic and creativity earned him the nickname "The Wizard of Menlo Park",
      referring to his famous laboratory in New Jersey. His legacy continues to influence 
      technology and innovation globally.</p>

          <h3>Electric Light Bulb</h3>
          <div>
            <h5>his dream of inventing bulb to transform society by making electric light accessible:</h5>
            <p>
               Edison believed electric light could extend the 
               productive hours of the day, improve public safety, 
               and boost education and business.
              It changed how people lived, worked, and played.
            </p>
            <h5>Why it’s interesting:</h5>
            <p>
               It Changed the World
               The light bulb didn’t just give us light — it revolutionized human life:
               Extended the day beyond sunset
               Made homes, streets, and workplaces safer
               Allowed cities to grow and businesses to operate longer

          <h3>Phonograph</h3>

          <div>
            <h5>A Phonograph Record sounds and Play it back later </h5>
            <p>
              The phonograph is made using a few simple parts that work together 
              to record and play sound. It has a horn that collects sound waves,
              which then vibrate a thin diaphragm. Attached to the diaphragm is 
              a needle (stylus) that moves with the sound vibrations. When recording, 
              this needle presses into a rotating cylinder covered with soft material
              like tinfoil or wax, creating grooves that match the sound. 
            </p>
            <h5>Cool twist:</h5>
            <p>
              Edison invented the phonograph for business use,
              not music! But people loved using it to play songs
              by accident, it became the start of the music industry.

          <h3>Motion Picture Camera</h3>
          <div>
            <h5>Motion Picture Camera</h5>
            <p>
              The motion picture camera, also known as a movie camera,
              is a device used to record moving images on film. 
              It works by rapidly capturing a series of still photographs,
              called frames, at high speed — usually 24 frames per second.
            </p>
            <h5>Fun fact:</h5>
            <p>
              The first motion picture ever recorded with Edison’s
              camera was called "Monkeyshines, No. 1,
              filmed in 1889 or 1890 — and it lasted only 
              a few seconds! It showed a blurry figure moving around,
              and while it wasn’t clear, it was the first time human
              movement was captured on film, marking the birth of 
              motion pictures. Imagine: today's entire film industry 
              began with just a few seconds of blurry footage!

          <h3>Electric Power Distribution System</h3>
          <div>
            <h5>The electric power distribution system is a network that delivers electricity from power plants for everyday use.
</h5>
            <p>
               The electric power distribution system carries electricity from 
               power plants to substations, and then through power lines, transformers
               ,and pole to homes, schools, and businesses. It converts 
               high-voltage power into lower, usable voltage,
               making safe and reliable electricity available for daily life.

            </p>
            <h5>The showman side:</h5>
            <p>
               Thomas Edison is called the showman of the electric power
               distribution system because he not only invented it but
               also publicly demonstrated its power by lighting
               up New York City in 1882, proving electricity could transform daily life.
